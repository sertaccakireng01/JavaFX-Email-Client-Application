As a project of my Advanced Java Programming course, I developed a fully functional desktop email client using JavaFX that earned a 90% score. 
This application is not just a UI design; it is a working system capable of composing and sending real emails, replying to messages, and handling file attachments. 
By translating complex functional mockups into an interactive GUI, I implemented features like multi-host management and dynamic window resizing while maintaining a clean MVC architecture. 
This project was a major milestone in my development, as it required seamless integration of GUI event handling, file I/O operations, and robust exception handling to ensure a reliable user experience.
