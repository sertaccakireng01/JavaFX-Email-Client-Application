YouTube Video of Running Project: https://youtu.be/B4pHRZuQ3cI

As a project of my Advanced Java Programming course, I developed a fully functional desktop email client that earned a 90% score. 
This application is a complete, working system designed to handle real-world email operations through a professional and responsive user interface.

Key Features:

-Real-Time Operations: Capable of composing, sending, and replying to real emails.

-Attachment Management: Full support for handling and sending file attachments.

-Multi-Host Support: Integrated management for multiple email hosts and account setups.

-Dynamic UI: A responsive interface built with JavaFX that maintains consistency during window resizing.

-Functional Mockup Integration: Successfully translated complex functional requirements into a production-ready GUI.

Technical Highlights:

-Architecture: Strictly followed the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for a clean separation of concerns.

-Core Technologies: JavaFX, Java Mail API, and SceneBuilder.

-Robustness: Implemented comprehensive Exception Handling to manage network issues and file I/O operations.

-Event Handling: Sophisticated GUI event management for a seamless user experience.

This project was a major milestone in my development as a Computer Engineering student. 
It required a deep understanding of how to integrate backend logic with a dynamic frontend while ensuring the system remains stable under various runtime conditions.
